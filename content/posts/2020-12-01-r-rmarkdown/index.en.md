As someone who previously trained with power lifters, I've always been mindful of my nutrition, especially protein intake and overall macros. Now that I’m getting back into working out, that awareness has kicked back in. Tracking calories and macros is straightforward when I’m prepping meals at home, but eating out makes things more complicated. Nutritional info is often scattered across websites, menus, or hard-to-read PDFs. I created this dashboard as a centralized tool to quickly calculate the calories and macro nutrients in meals from my favorite fast-casual restaurants, no extra searching or guessing required.
