title: About Me
---

My name is Joel Winner, and I am a recent graduate of The Ohio State University with a B.S. in Statistics.
Before graduating, I worked as a Data Analyst Intern for the American Conservation Coalition, while also bartending and serving as an undergraduate teaching assistant.

In my free time, I enjoy working on projects that combine statistics and sports.
Many of my past projects have focused on Major League Baseball and NCAA football, where Iâ€™ve applied the statistical methods learned in school to explore real-world sports analytics questions.

Feel free to explore the projects posted in the projects subsection here.
