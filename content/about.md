title: About Me
---

My name is Joel Winner and I am a recent graduate from The Ohio State University with a B.S. in Statistics.  
Before graduating, I was a data analyst intern for the American Conservation Coalition, as well as bartending and working as an undergraduate teaching assistant.

In my free time, I enjoy working on projects at the intersection of statistics and sports.  
Many of my past projects involved Major League Baseball or NCAA football.  
These projects have prioritized exploring real-world sports questions using the methods Iâ€™ve learned in school.

Feel free to explore the projects posted in the projects subsection here.
